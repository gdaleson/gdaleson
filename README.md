# Interests

## Continuous Integration & Delivery

Everybody _says_ they do CI&D. I have not had _nearly_ enough [mojitos](https://twitter.com/jezhumble/status/910202369354297344)* for this to be true.

My hunch is that this is about the daily work of engineering. What does daily reproducible progress look like? Are your people getting something done every single day, even if it's something small?

*I don't drink. Certain butler-themed applications used for these purposes have occasionally made me revisit this decision.

## Data Science

There's a lot going on here. The field is maybe a decade old or so, and there are some really neat success stories where people have mixed acres of data with the right raw statistical theory and distilled useful knowledge out of that reaction.

On the other hand, sometimes [it _explodes_](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html).

I'd really like to get this kind of work done safely, but I suspect we're still in the early phases. I'd settle for doing it reproducibly.

## Microservices

One microservice is easy. Multiple microservices are not so easy. Sometimes, when microservices depend on each other, it can drive people madder than a bastard on Father's Day.

## Kubernetes

I can _spell_ it. At some point I really should learn more about it.

## [Nightscout](http://www.nightscout.info/) & [The Nightscout Foundation](https://www.nightscoutfoundation.org/)

I am one of the few people I know who has saved a family member's life with open source software. My son is a type 1 diabetic, and this is what we've used in the past to monitor his blood sugar at school.

I keep thinking there has to be a way to make the setup and operation of this easier. Somewhere, in all my dev/ops experience - both days of it - there has to be an idea or two about how to staple together some infrastructure-as-code so that setting up a new site becomes more "push the button" and less "slay the hydra with the minotaur horn, take the twelve stones of power, and activate the medallion at the exact moment of total eclipse".

# Thanks

I've been fortunate enough to have a wonderful family, good friends, and I've run into lots of people who I've learned from. Some of them even put up with me voluntarily! I'm grateful to all of them, and more besides.
